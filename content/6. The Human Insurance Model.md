The challenges of complexity inflation point toward a fundamental rethinking of how we structure relationships in organizations and networks. What I call the "Human Insurance Model" offers a framework for creating high-value connections while minimizing the coordination costs that typically accompany growth.

## Low-Cost Relationship Formation

Traditional organizational models implicitly assume that relationships should be difficult to form but also difficult to break. Employment contracts, vendor agreements, and departmental structures all create high-friction environments for both establishing and ending relationships. This approach made sense in an industrial economy where stability and specialization were paramount.

The Human Insurance Model inverts this assumption: relationships should be extremely easy to form but retain the option to dissolve if they don't create value. This aligns with what transaction cost economics reveals about optimal governance structures:

- **Low Initial Commitment**: By reducing upfront investment in relationship formation, organizations can explore more potential connections without prohibitive costs.
- **Clear Mutual Understanding**: Explicit clarity about expectations, capabilities, and deliverables reduces the information asymmetries that Akerlof identified as market-destroying.
- **Reputation Mechanisms**: In business-to-business markets, reputation systems reduce monitoring costs by creating long-term incentives for cooperative behavior. Research shows a supplier's reluctance to jeopardize future contracts often proves more effective than legal penalties in ensuring quality compliance.

Oliver Williamson's framework identifies three critical dimensions that shape optimal relationship structures: asset specificity (investments tailored to particular relationships), uncertainty (incomplete contracts when future contingencies cannot be specified), and frequency (repeated interactions that justify trust-building).

The Human Insurance Model acknowledges these factors while emphasizing relationship optionality—the ability to form and dissolve connections based on value creation rather than structural inertia.

## Increasing Returns to Relationship Longevity

While making relationships easy to form, the model simultaneously creates powerful incentives for maintaining them over time. Long-term relationships yield increasing returns through:

- **Knowledge Accumulation**: The stated vs. revealed preference gap shrinks over time as parties learn each other's true needs and capabilities.
- **Trust Development**: Repeated positive interactions reduce monitoring costs and enable higher-risk, higher-reward collaborations.
- **Process Optimization**: Partners develop specialized protocols that enhance coordination efficiency—what economists call relationship-specific investments.

This increasing-returns dynamic explains why Amazon's marketplace vendors average 7.8 years on the platform despite no contractual obligations to remain. The value of accumulated reputation, streamlined processes, and customer relationships creates natural retention without enforcement mechanisms.

Similarly, startup ecosystems exhibit this pattern through investor relationships. Convertible notes and equity stakes align founder-investor incentives by tying compensation to long-term performance. Recent studies highlight how platforms like AngelList aggregate startup data, enabling cross-investor verification of claims while mitigating duplication in due diligence efforts.

## The Efficiency of Quick Separations for Misaligned Partnerships

Perhaps most importantly, the Human Insurance Model recognizes that not all relationships should persist. When value creation falls below coordination costs, both parties benefit from dissolution.

In traditional models, ending relationships carries enormous costs—terminating employees, switching vendors, or reorganizing departments all consume significant resources. These high separation costs lead to inefficient relationship persistence, where partnerships continue despite negative value creation.

Three key principles govern efficient separations:

- **Modular Independence**: Relationships should be structured to minimize interdependencies, allowing clean separation when needed.
- **Knowledge Portability**: Critical information should be documented and transferable, reducing the relationship-specific knowledge that makes separation costly.
- **Continuous Evaluation**: Regular assessment of value creation relative to coordination costs provides early indicators for potential separation.

When properly designed, this approach allows organizations to maintain fluid networks of relationships that optimize value creation while minimizing complexity overhead. Companies like Morning Star Farms operationalize this through colleague letters of understanding—agreements between employees that specify mutual expectations, deliverables, and evaluation criteria.

## The Human Insurance Model in Practice

Forward-thinking organizations are implementing variations of this model across multiple relationship types:

- **Employment**: Companies like Haier treat employees as internal entrepreneurs with substantial autonomy but clear performance expectations. This creates a dynamic where continued employment depends on value creation rather than hierarchical positioning.
- **Supply Chain**: Blockchain-enabled supply chains maintain real-time, location-specific data flows from individual shipping containers to global logistics planners, reducing stockouts by 33% while creating transparent performance metrics for all participants.
- **Innovation Networks**: Open innovation platforms allow companies to explore collaboration with minimal upfront investment, while strengthening relationships with the most productive partners over time.

The Human Insurance Model directly addresses complexity inflation by preventing the accumulation of low-value relationships that consume coordination resources. It emphasizes dynamic optimization over static structure, aligning with what successful startups do intuitively during their early stages.

In our next section, we'll explore how these principles become even more crucial in the age of AI, where algorithmic capabilities can dramatically enhance human collaboration while potentially introducing new forms of complexity.
