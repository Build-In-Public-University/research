I want to do this as a public way to build interest in the project.

I can build a simple page with a form that will allow people to share a paper and an email to receive updates on the project. Also an optional input to share possible errors. (possible error mention won't be used in prediction, only checking from prediction to result.)

TODO:
[/] build form
[/] share online

Analytics to track progress:
impressions
submissions
emails
Bonus: predictions of errors
